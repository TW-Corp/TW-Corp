      <h4>By: Tyler Larson, TW Corp. Web Developer - December 5, 2016</h4>
        <p> 	The TW Stock is actually not doing so good. “Well you see the stocks haven’t really gone up or down mostly because, well there is no stock on the market yet!” as said by Co-Founder Tyler Larson. This shocking statement triggered millions of investors across the globe, lowering The TW Corp. Stock by 99.9%, that is if there was a stock.<br></p>
<p>	Also, on Monday, in the late afternoon, The TW IA (The TW Investment Agency) was founded. In a press interview early Tuesday morning, Wilson Rabe was quoted as saying, “The Investment Agency actually only has 2 agents.” This statement once again, triggered millions of people, including investors, bystanders and viewers of the news station. It seems that everything The TW Corp. says is bad.<br></p><p>The TW Corp. has also said early Thursday morning that they plan to purchase Abdurahman Zine’s company “Appdu” and rename it “Appdu - A TW Company”. Abdu, founder of the crippling Appdu company, stated in a release that “I will buy The TW Corp. and make it better, then sell it back to Wilson and Tyler.” Everyone knows that this  statement is of course not true.</p>
